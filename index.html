<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;"><large>  Data Science Portfolio by William Ma</large></h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;LINE-HEIGHT:30px;">
	The portfolio is a complilation of Jupyter Notebooks which I created for data exploration 
and machine learning analysis. Projects are listed by different categories. All projects are implemented by Python.

<h2>Standalone Project: Boston Marathon Data Analysis </h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;LINE-HEIGHT:30px;">
	Exploratory Data Analysis is applied on 2017 Boston Marathon dataset for different ages, genders, and the time records by distance splits.
"Pace stabiliy" is calculated by the statistical indicator Coefficient of Variation to describe how stable the pace is for each runners during the whole marathon.
The result shows that good runners tend to run more stably in every periods of pace.

<h2>Regression Problem: House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle competition)</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;LINE-HEIGHT:30px;">
	This project is a compeition in Kaggle with initially 79 features for the residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The goal of this challenge is 
to predict the final price of each home. As usual, data exploration, feature engineering are applied, then several machine learning models are built to predict 
the house price in the test set. Linear Regression and XGBoost are implemented to predict house price with hundreds of features.

<h2>Classification Problem: Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle competition)</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;LINE-HEIGHT:30px;">
	Titanic is a famous competition in Kaggle. Many people start machine learning projects from this Kaggle Competition, so do I. 
Although the data in Kaggle competition is usually from better structured dataset, I still think it's a very good training platform as well as
 a good place to gain data science experience on EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning by learning from so many experts around the world.
